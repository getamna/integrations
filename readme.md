### Integrations

Abstracts way multiple APIs to give you a shared library to call against different services such as Mail, Calendar, Work Tracking.

We designed shared interfaces for them . [Example interface]("sdsd")

- [x] All communication handled directly from library
- [x] Typescript Bindings
- [x] Support for Mail, Calendar, Task and Work Tracking
- [x] Used in [Amna](getamna.com)

### ðŸ’¸ Monetized with Libmon ðŸ’¸

Similar to services such as Nylas or Kloudless.

You may demo the library for free, and purchase a **one-time** access token for complete library usage. Read limits and [pricing](https://libmon.com)

#### Demo Limits

Token limits for SDDS

- Max 10 function calls in Calendar, Mail API
- Only 1 Task Service (Google, Todoist, Microsoft)

### Usage

```javascript
const { Integrations } = require("Integrations")

// after successful oauth, pass in a set of access tokens.
const opts = {
  authorizers: {
    Microsoft: "<user access token>",
    Google: "<user access token>",
  },
}

const integrations = new Integrations(opts, "DEMO_TOKEN")
const outlook = integrations.getMailService(MailServiceType.Microsoft)
const gmail = integrations.getMailService(MailServiceType.Google)

const draftMessage = {
  to: ["hi@libmon.com"],
  cc: [],
  bcc: [],
  subject: "Hello!",
  body: "Hey from our awesome library!!",
}

// send an email
const gmailResp = gmail.send(draftMessage)
const outlookResp = outlook.send(draftMessage)
```

### Services

Supported Services:
| Service | Providers |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Mail | Outlook, Google |
| Calendar | Outlook, Google |
| Tasks | Microsoft, Todoist, Google |
| Work | Azure DevOps, Jira, Asana, Github |

### Authentication

This library does not provide UI for authentication to an OAuth Provider. If you purchased a token, you can purchase our OAuth Helper for Javascript that works with most 3rd party providers. [See here](#)

You can obtainin tokens from Google and Microsoft for [testing](#)

## Interface and API Definitions

All interface definitions can be found in our [Public Github Repo](https://github.com)

Not all methods have been implemented. There are also slight variations between two APIs.

### Support

Library supporters have the ability to open support tickets. Because we are strapped on resources, we will prioritize token purchasers first.

To test various OAuth flows, you can get personal tokens from various providers. Here are a few ways.

#### Microsoft

1. Login to [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer)

2. Make a request and click on the Access Token Tab

3. To edit and create scopes for your token, look at the **Modify Permissions** tab

#### Google

1. Visit the [Google OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)

2. Make sure to exchange your authorize token and get an access token.

You can pass these tokens into the authorizer options of the [Integrations Library[].
