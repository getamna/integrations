See all available methods and interfaces in the [Wiki](https://github.com/getamna/integrations/wiki)

### Usage

```typescript
import {
  Integrations,
  IntegrationOptions,
  MailServiceType,
} from "integrations-lib"

// after successful oauth, pass in a set of access tokens.
const opts: IntegrationOptions = {
  authorizers: {
    Microsoft: {
      apiToken: "<user access token>",
    },
    Google: {
      apiToken: "<user access token>",
    },
  },
}

const integrations = new Integrations(opts, "DEMO_TOKEN")

const outlook = integrations.getMailService(MailServiceType.Microsoft)
const gmail = integrations.getMailService(MailServiceType.Google)

const draftMessage = {
  to: ["integrations@getamna.com"],
  cc: [],
  bcc: [],
  subject: "Whoa, this library works!",
  body: "Hey, we just sent you and email from our awesome library!",
}

sendMail()

async function sendMail() {
  // send an email
  const gmailResp = await gmail.send(draftMessage)
  const outlookResp = await outlook.send(draftMessage)
}
```

### Authentication

This library does not provide UI for authentication to an OAuth Provider. If you purchased a token, you can purchase our OAuth Helper for Javascript that works with most 3rd party providers.

You can obtain tokens from Google and Microsoft for [testing](https://github.com/getamna/integrations/wiki/Personal-Auth-Tokens)

## Interface and API Definitions

All interface definitions can be found in our [Public Github Repo](https://github.com/getamna/integrations)

Not all methods have been implemented. There may also be slight variations between two APIs. Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/getamna/integrations/wiki).
